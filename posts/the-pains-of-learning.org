* Pain

  I am writing this because I am learning programming. I find it hard
  and frustrating, but I tell myself not to worry---as learning any
  skill has a dose of pain and frustration. It comes with the territory.

  Learning is hard because it means taking the conscious decision of
  walking along a painful path.  This is not only hard because of the
  hardships that we will unavoidably find along the way; but because we
  decided to do it and so there is no one to blame but ourselves when we
  face a challenge.  Yes, learning can be beautiful too; but, so is love
  and there is no need to tell you how painful love can be.  Yet, in the
  case of learning, the pain is assured and eternal. The only
  variability of the pains of learning are of the shapes that it will
  take in the future.

  It seems that, as long as we are in this universe governed by certain
  /laws of physics/, we are doomed to live with this pain whenever we
  want to learn anything. So, we better accept it as soon as possible
  and move on with our lives.  Otherwise, we will either stagnate,
  because we will abhor learning; or become constantly frustrated, due
  to our, rather ironic, inability when learning how to learn.

  We live in a universe where, before you move the ball forward, you
  have to push it using your energy; burning calories in the
  process. There is no way around it. You could use less calories than
  others or take a shorter path to your destination, but there is a
  certain amount of effort (pain) that you will not be able to
  circumvent.  I call this the Exercise Principle.

  The word /exercise/ comes from latin 'ex' (thoroughly) and 'arcere'
  (keep in or away). To build muscles you have to constantly push or
  pull your muscles, sometimes with heavy obstacles in between the
  current position of your muscle and the place where you want your
  muscle to be.

  This definition applies everywhere, from heavy-lifting to marathons.
  As you exercise, your muscles become stronger and the obstacles stop
  being a hindrance. The pain goes away.  However, as the pain starts to
  fade, you have to increase the load so that the pain increases
  again. If you increase the body load by the same amount each day, you
  get linear progression, an effective workout system for beginners.
  What makes this fitness program so effective is the fact that the pain
  delta is constant and the pain of each day either stays the same or
  increases.  This might not make it a good program if you want a high
  percentage of people who completed the program. But, it will make it a
  great program if you want a high percentage of people who are fit by
  the end of the program.

  To choose learning all the time is admirable. Chasing knowledge is the
  ritual by which you accept that there is something wrong with you (a
  knowledge gap) and that you will follow a brutal path in the process
  of fixing it.  Accepting such a depressing reality is the first step
  towards improving in whatever it is you want to become better at.

* Programming

  It is not often to see programmers---or even people---out there to be
  talking about their vulnerabilities.  Maybe it is because they treat
  their inner self the same way they treat some of the software they
  write; afraid of what hackers might do to their systems.  But for me,
  whenever I see someone talking about their weaknesses---especially
  masters at their craft---I feel incredibly relieved.

  Whenever people write about their problems and struggles, they let you
  know that they are not super-humans. In this process, they are letting
  you know that they were in your shoes too---and they managed to get
  out. For the ones who are struggling, these are almost immediate
  morale boosters.

  Hence, if you have a modicum of skill at something, whatever that
  might be, I encourage you to write about your failures as much (if not
  more) as your successes.  Future generations will be thankful for your
  words. In fact, you might even revisit your past thoughts and you will
  feel proud of the difficulties of life that you managed to beat.

* Hard over easy; simple over complex

  Strive for simplicity and hardship. These are the principles that
  have led me to learn =vim=, =emacs=, and now =clojure=.

  Some people want an easy life.  In fact, I may even say most people.
  They look for the shortcut, the /easy/ way out, the cheating codes.
  It might be human nature to chase easy, we were almost programmed to
  do it.  After all, calories did not use to be this cheap back
  then. But society has created new ecosystems that are unbeknownst to
  our DNA. A society with abundance that we can exploit to go higher
  and deeper in the conquest of knowledge.  For me, that means
  learning to deal with physical and mental pain in the process of
  understanding computers.

  However, this does not mean that one should chase complexity.
  Simple and easy are two different concepts. The same happens for
  hard and complex.  The word simple comes from the Latin /sem/ and
  /plo/, meaning "one" and "fold".  I like using a space analogy,
  since we humans are good at it. A one fold path can be imagined as a
  straight path between a point A and B. This is a simple
  path. However, walking that path could take days. Thus, we say that
  is a hard path. Yet, it is a simple path, what is going on here?

  Well, while simple can be referred as "one fold", easy comes from
  the Old French /aisie/. This means "at ease" or "comfortable". Now,
  "ease" comes the Latin form of /adiacens/ or /adiacere/, which means
  "border upon" or "lie near". With this definitions under our belt,
  our space analogy seems to be a fit one. Something easy is something
  at reach, which is why this simple---but long---path of ours seems
  so... hard. Yet, if we truly wanted to go to destination B, we would
  take this simple (and hard) path any day any time instead of taking
  one of its possible /convoluted/[fn:1] alternatives.

  Before the COVID-19 pandemic I was a regular at my local gym.  While
  I was no Hercules by any means, I considered myself fit.  When
  others asked me about my workout routine, many seemed flabbergasted
  to know about how stupid simple my routine was.  I only did three
  core exercises with the same number of repetitions each time. "Is
  that all?" many friends would say. To which I would respond: Yes,
  you only need to do that 152 times each year, increasing the weights
  each new day. After three years, you will be unrecognizable.

  -- But you said it was easy!

  -- No, I said it was simple.

[fn:1] I hope that you now see the word /Convoluted/ with different
eyes.
