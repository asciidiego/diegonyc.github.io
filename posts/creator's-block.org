How do you learn to draw? How do you learn to write? How do you learn
to walk? Well, the same way (current) computers learn. You perform the
action you want to learn over and over. Is that simple.

This is why is funny to me when others say that they do not try to
draw because they do not know how. Those same people were once babies
that drew all over the place and were babbling in their way to
learning their native tongue. Isn't that funny? And I do not mean
/funny/ funny, more like /sad/ funny.

Despite all of this, most adults are stuck in the /tutorial hell/ of
life figuring out how to get out of the rat race while there are [[https://youtu.be/6EM2U8v-KTg][kids]]
that (might) seem to know the huge leverage we have today; not only
are they programming the robot army of the future, they are publishing
about how they did it at the same time. All while going to
school. Naval would be [[https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002106317064949763][proud]].

Most of the people out there would be better off coding instead of
wondering how to code[fn:1][fn:2]. This is not me criticizing
others. This is me talking to myself. Telling what, deep inside, I
already knew. You only need to get going. That is all it takes to
truly build something. To create something new in this world.

At first, you should not worry whether that /new/ thing is of
value. The path to skill has ups and downs. But, if you stay wondering
eternally about the /Travelling Salesman Problem/ you will not travel
nor sell anything.

A beloved and smart friend once told me that as long as you keep
building and thinking there is virtually nothing that you cannot do.
I think this is sound advice. My gut has been telling me all of this
for a long time now. Why then do we hesitate so much when listening to
it? I have a hypothesis: we are afraid we might be wrong; we might be
find out that we are more than able to accomplish gigantic things.

This is why so many people love the genius story. The story about the
person whose brain were once touched by God or Midas itself when they
were born. And ever since then their willpower was only unmatched by
their IQ. How are we supposed to compete with these individuals?

I think that is wishful thinking. It is easier to imagine that we are
our brain is not in top 0.05%. That we do not have enough willpower
and that it cannot be trained. That there is no way that we can become
rich or create anything valuable.

Not only I think is false, but I also think that it matters less and
less as time goes by. The more time passes the more leverage we
have. Writers reach millions on pennies. Musicians can play for the
masses. Programmers can control so many processors that we literally
don't know what to do with them anymore. This is the new Renaissance
Age. A new age kindled by the spark of transistors instead of the
printing press or the steam engine.

Software will keep eating the world and will increase its complexity
in the process. The world will get noisier as well. Abundance will
turn into scarcity; where there is a lot, there is a lot to sort
out. I invite all of the adults reading my words to think about
children. All kinds of children, including you as a child.

What would a lot of children with infinite healthy food, no reason to
fight one another, and tools all over the place do? I want to live in
that human society. One full of artists, engineers, philosophers,
caring parents, and happy elders. Perhaps even, one where death is a
choice among the ones with a soul–whatever that is.

Before we arrive to that, or anything close, you and I need to
build. Build as if our life depended on it. Of course, not everybody
will be an artist, an entrepreneur, an engineer, or a scientist. And I
am not bold enough to guess the roles of future humans. But there is
something I do know.

If you want to do whatever you want, first, you must...

/make something that people want/

learn about business by reading about business; and you are definitely
not going to learn about business reading about learning about
business.
