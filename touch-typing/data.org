* What is this?

  This is a document documenting my touch typing lessons at the [[https://www.typing.academy/][Typing
  Academy web site]].

  The methodology that I am following is simple. I take a lesson every
  day and, after I finish, I do a 2 minute typing test. Finally, I
  record my results here a put a timestamp on it.
