    A representation of writer's block by Leonid Pasternak
    (1862 â€“ 1945)
  </p>

_For days I have felt blocked; and I know that, in these cases, the <br/>
best thing you can do is to create non-stop._ <br/>

I thought about this some days ago. Then I decided to write an essay <br/>
about it.  After all, if you feel a certain way, you can be confident <br/>
that others feel that way too---this is _Being Human 101_[^fn:1]. <br/>

The creative forces that drive your mind are not immune to Newton's <br/>
laws of motion---especially the first one&nbsp;[^fn:2]. Thus, if you apply <br/>
force to create, your mind will keep a somewhat steady rate of <br/>
creation.  This is not unique to objects in the physical world or the <br/>
creative mind; this happens with habits as well.  Do you know why <br/>
after you stop working out for a while, if you are not careful, you <br/>
stop altogether?  Newton does. <br/>

Why, then, do we hesitate so much when trying to overcome this <br/>
opposite force to creativity?  If we only need to keep creating, why <br/>
don't we do it more? <br/>

After some thought of what the cause might be, my best bet is <br/>
fear. Fear of wasting one's life pursuing a potentially bad course. <br/>
If there is anything that haunts people at night it is the feeling <br/>
that they are not living their ephemeral life to the fullest.  At <br/>
least that is my fear. It seems a recurrent theme among artists <br/>
too[^fn:3]. <br/>

Then, the answer is simple: just work on that which you are good <br/>
at. But, how are we supposed to know what we are good at without <br/>
trying it first? My guess is that you cannot. You must try that <br/>
something more than once---some even define _trying_ as engaging in <br/>
the task at hand for years. <br/>

Until you find something that looks like work to others but play to <br/>
you, keep exploring.  Use your innate curiosity.  Then, start <br/>
learning[^fn:4]. <br/>

Now, how do you learn to draw, write, or, well, do anything?  The same <br/>
way computers learn. You perform the action you want to learn over and <br/>
over. It is that simple. The efficiency and effectiveness depends on <br/>
many factors---such as genes or the environment. But, while the <br/>
factors that define the learning rate are somewhat variable, the way <br/>
to learn is constant. <br/>

This is why it is funny to me when others say that they do not try to <br/>
draw because they do not know how. Those same people were once babies <br/>
that drew all over the place and were babbling in their way to <br/>
learning their native tongue(s). Isn't that funny? And I do not mean <br/>
_funny_ funny, more like _sad_ funny. <br/>

Despite many people knowing all of this, most adults are stuck in the <br/>
_tutorial purgatory_[^fn:5] of life figuring out how to get out of the <br/>
rat race. Meanwhile, there are [kids](https://youtu.be/6EM2U8v-KTg) that seem to know the huge <br/>
leverage we have today and, bear with me, seem to have fun in the <br/>
process. Can you believe it? Not only are they programming the robot <br/>
army of the future; they are publishing about how they did it at the <br/>
same time. All while going to school. Naval Ravikant and Paul Graham <br/>
would be [proud](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002106317064949763). <br/>

Most of the people out there would be better off coding instead of <br/>
wondering how to code[^fn:6]<sup>, </sup>[^fn:7]. This is not me criticizing <br/>
others. This is me talking to myself about what, deep inside, I <br/>
already knew. You only need to get going. That is all it takes to <br/>
truly build something. To create something new in this world. <br/>

At first, you should not worry whether that _new_ thing is of <br/>
value. Just like we cannot judge a butterfly in its larval form, we <br/>
cannot judge our future work based on how it looks now. We do this <br/>
naturally. This is why so many great ideas are disregarded so <br/>
baldly. <br/>

The path to skill has ups and downs. But, if you stay wondering <br/>
eternally about the _Travelling Salesman Problem_ you will not travel <br/>
nor sell anything. And it is better to go back to where you started <br/>
instead of never having moved in the first place[^fn:8]. <br/>

A beloved and smart friend once told me kind words. I think they apply <br/>
to more people than I would have imagined: <br/>

_Never ever stop. Continue building, creating, and thinking. There are <br/>
virtually no limits to how far you can get._ <br/>

Do you ever wonder why many people love the genius story? The story <br/>
about the person whose brain was once touched by God or Midas himself <br/>
when they were born? How are we supposed to compete with these <br/>
individuals?  "Why even bother" is what we tell ourselves to appease <br/>
our anxiety.  To rationalize our laziness. <br/>

I think that is wishful thinking. One does not need to be Einstein to <br/>
become rich. Yet, it is easier to imagine that our brain is not in the <br/>
top 0.05% and, thus, there is no point in trying. Or so we tell <br/>
ourselves. <br/>

I believe that we should work hard despite our perceived weaknesses, <br/>
because they matter less than we think. And even less as time goes <br/>
by. The more leverage we have, thanks to programming and media, the <br/>
less our marginal differences in intelligence matter to achieve <br/>
certain things.  At least, so that we all live comfortably.  Writers <br/>
reach millions spending pennies---if any--by using online <br/>
blogs. Musicians play for the masses on Spotify without the <br/>
distribution costs of CDs. Programmers can control so many processors <br/>
for free that they don't even know what to do with them. It has come <br/>
to the point where they program the robot army to create applications <br/>
about memes[^fn:9]. This is the new Renaissance Age. One kindled by the <br/>
spark of transistors instead of the printing press or the steam <br/>
engine. So, go out there and learn some useful skills. A good place to <br/>
start is math. <br/>

Software will keep eating the world and will increase its complexity <br/>
in the process. There is a lot to build. The world will get noisier as <br/>
well. In the Information Age, information overload is the order of the <br/>
day. Abundance creates a particular form of scarcity; where there is a <br/>
lot, there is a lot to sort out. So, let us build the tools that will <br/>
help us tackle this paradox. <br/>

As for me, I will continue to learn about computer science and math. <br/>
However, I still need to refine my interests; to find <br/>
knowledge-interest fit[^fn:10].  Finding what one loves is not <br/>
easy[^fn:11].  In fact, I have not done it myself.  Computer science, <br/>
math, and art is a subset in the set of all human knowledge, but that <br/>
is not enough.  One must find a subset you feel passionate about--at <br/>
the bare minimum. <br/>

You need to enjoy your work more than your unproductive pleasures. <br/>
What I call _creator's block_ in this essay is part block and part <br/>
procrastination.  Nobody procrastinates when they are doing something <br/>
exciting---even work. Thus, if you find yourself procrastinating like <br/>
I do, perhaps you need to redefine what work is for you. <br/>

If you want to beat the creator's block, tackle the root causes . <br/>
Procrastination fades when you are working in something that makes you <br/>
admire yourself.  While we are our own worst critic, we have all felt <br/>
proud of our accomplishments.  I am not talking about artificial <br/>
accomplishments such as a getting your college degree, getting into <br/>
medical school, or finding a new job.  These are external rewards <br/>
crafted by society, not by your inner self.  They are accomplishments <br/>
on paper and will only make you happy on paper as well. <br/>

If it is not artificial problems, what kind of problems are we talking <br/>
about?  I am talking about those problems that you solved and made you <br/>
go into the mirror and think: you rock.  For example, my mom is bad <br/>
with electronic devices. One day, though, she fixed her own phone from <br/>
a virus and felt ecstatic about it for three days straight.  What is <br/>
amusing and endearing about this situation is that I remember that she <br/>
once got a salary increase and did not feel as happy. When she got her <br/>
raise it felt like the happiness lasted for less than a third of time <br/>
and was not as intense in comparison to when she fixed her phone by <br/>
herself.  Work on those kind of problems.  The ones that make you and <br/>
your friends think, wow, that is pretty cool. <br/>

In the end, YCombinator's motto of _make something people want_ <br/>
applies to you in the first place.  Follow the airlines principle of <br/>
helping yourself before you start helping others.  Until you start <br/>
working on something that people want, you should be working on <br/>
something that you want.  And before that, you should be working on <br/>
finding out what is it that you want to work on.  You only need one <br/>
home run to win the game. <br/>

[^fn:1]: My gut tells me that realizing this early in life is <br/>
    important. Particularly if you want to create a startup. <br/>
[^fn:2]: An object will not change its motion unless a force acts on it. <br/>
[^fn:3]: For example, Leonardo Da Vinci is famous to have said "I have <br/>
    offended God and mankind because my work did not reach the quality it <br/>
    should have.". Allegedly. <br/>
[^fn:4]: This problem is so pervasive that computer scientists even have <br/>
    a name for it: the explore-exploit problem. <br/>
[^fn:5]: Tutorial purgatory---or tutorial hell---is what some computer <br/>
    programmers call the phase where one is attending courses and reading <br/>
    manuals instead of building new things.  I call it the Anti-[Feynmann <br/>
    Technique](https://fs.blog/2021/02/feynman-learning-technique/) of learning.  The only way you can learn is by explaining <br/>
    what you learn and using that information in a variety of situations. <br/>
[^fn:6]: As Kevin O'Leary said about business: you are not going to <br/>
    learn about business by reading about business; and you are definitely <br/>
    not going to learn about business reading about learning about <br/>
    business. <br/>
[^fn:7]: After all, that is [the most important quality of code](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1247081777547616266). <br/>
[^fn:8]: this is why this essay is online despite its flaws; preach what <br/>
    you teach. <br/>
[^fn:9]: [Literally.](https://replit.com/apps/memes)  <br/>
[^fn:10]: If we imagine knowledge as a set of points and your interests <br/>
    as another, to work on what you love is to find the intersection <br/>
    between those two sets.  While I may have over-simplified it (since <br/>
    you also need to take into account your natural ability and other <br/>
    factors), I think that this is a good thumb rule to follow. <br/>
[^fn:11]: Paul Graham wrote a whole [essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html) about it. <br/>
