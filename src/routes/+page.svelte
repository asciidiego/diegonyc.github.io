		<h2>So, what do you do?</h2>

		<p>
			In 1987, Apple Computer, Inc. published the following quote in “Human Interface Guidelines:
			The Apple Desktop Interface”:
		</p>
		<q> The human interface is the sum of all communication between human and computer</q>.
		<p>
			Given Apple's prevalence in today's world, we can say that—to a significant degree—yes, the
			human interface <i>is</i> the sum of all communication between humans and computers. After
			all, the iPhone <i>is</i> a computer.
		</p>
		<p>
			We are not in 1987 anymore. It's {data.year} and personal computers and mobile devices are everywhere.
		</p>
		<p>Yet... human interfaces have barely changed.</p>

		<p>And that's good.</p>

		<p>
			A great predictor of optimality is time resistance; if something works for a long time, it
			will—probably—continue to do so. User interfaces are no exception.
		</p>

		<p>But.</p>

		<p>
			Where is the interface that sums all communication between natural and artificial
			intelligence?
		</p>

		<p>That's what I do.</p>
