#+SUBTITLE: Using a lisp dialect to build a website using only plain text files
#+AUTHOR: Diego Rodriguez

* Overview
Building a website from scratch. Why? **Fun**.
* Objectives
Be able to follow this flow:

1. Write post using the =.org= file format.
2. Upload to remote repository using =git=.
3. Using Github Actions (or any other CI/CD platform such as Gitlab) to
   automatically build a website using a, preferrably, lisp dialect such as
   Clojure.
   a. Bonus points if I make the website builder myself!
4. Wait and see the website posted. All automatically after step [2].
