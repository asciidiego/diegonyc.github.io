<i>
  <p>
    A representation of writer's block by Leonid Pasternak
    (1862 â€“ 1945)
  </p>
</i>

<p>
<i>For days I have felt blocked; and I know that, in these cases, the<br />
best thing you can do is to create non-stop.</i><br />
</p>

<p>
I thought about this some days ago. Then I decided to write an essay<br />
about it.  After all, if you feel a certain way, you can be confident<br />
that others feel that way too&#x2014;this is <i>Being Human 101</i><sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>.<br />
</p>

<p>
The creative forces that drive your mind are not immune to Newton's<br />
laws of motion&#x2014;especially the first one <sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>. Thus, if you apply<br />
force to create, your mind will keep a somewhat steady rate of<br />
creation.  This is not unique to objects in the physical world or the<br />
creative mind; this happens with habits as well.  Do you know why<br />
after you stop working out for a while, if you are not careful, you<br />
stop altogether?  Newton does.<br />
</p>

<p>
Why, then, do we hesitate so much when trying to overcome this<br />
opposite force to creativity?  If we only need to keep creating, why<br />
don't we do it more?<br />
</p>

<p>
After some thought of what the cause might be, my best bet is<br />
fear. Fear of wasting one's life pursuing a potentially bad course.<br />
If there is anything that haunts people at night it is the feeling<br />
that they are not living their ephemeral life to the fullest.  At<br />
least that is my fear. It seems a recurrent theme among artists<br />
too<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>.<br />
</p>

<p>
Then, the answer is simple: just work on that which you are good<br />
at. But, how are we supposed to know what we are good at without<br />
trying it first? My guess is that you cannot. You must try that<br />
something more than once&#x2014;some even define <i>trying</i> as engaging in<br />
the task at hand for years.<br />
</p>

<p>
Until you find something that looks like work to others but play to<br />
you, keep exploring.  Use your innate curiosity.  Then, start<br />
learning<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>.<br />
</p>

<p>
Now, how do you learn to draw, write, or, well, do anything?  The same<br />
way computers learn. You perform the action you want to learn over and<br />
over. It is that simple. The efficiency and effectiveness depends on<br />
many factors&#x2014;such as genes or the environment. But, while the<br />
factors that define the learning rate are somewhat variable, the way<br />
to learn is constant.<br />
</p>

<p>
This is why it is funny to me when others say that they do not try to<br />
draw because they do not know how. Those same people were once babies<br />
that drew all over the place and were babbling in their way to<br />
learning their native tongue(s). Isn't that funny? And I do not mean<br />
<i>funny</i> funny, more like <i>sad</i> funny.<br />
</p>

<p>
Despite many people knowing all of this, most adults are stuck in the<br />
<i>tutorial purgatory</i><sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup> of life figuring out how to get out of the<br />
rat race. Meanwhile, there are <a href="https://youtu.be/6EM2U8v-KTg">kids</a> that seem to know the huge<br />
leverage we have today and, bear with me, seem to have fun in the<br />
process. Can you believe it? Not only are they programming the robot<br />
army of the future; they are publishing about how they did it at the<br />
same time. All while going to school. Naval Ravikant and Paul Graham<br />
would be <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002106317064949763">proud</a>.<br />
</p>

<p>
Most of the people out there would be better off coding instead of<br />
wondering how to code<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup>. This is not me criticizing<br />
others. This is me talking to myself about what, deep inside, I<br />
already knew. You only need to get going. That is all it takes to<br />
truly build something. To create something new in this world.<br />
</p>

<p>
At first, you should not worry whether that <i>new</i> thing is of<br />
value. Just like we cannot judge a butterfly in its larval form, we<br />
cannot judge our future work based on how it looks now. We do this<br />
naturally. This is why so many great ideas are disregarded so<br />
baldly.<br />
</p>

<p>
The path to skill has ups and downs. But, if you stay wondering<br />
eternally about the <i>Travelling Salesman Problem</i> you will not travel<br />
nor sell anything. And it is better to go back to where you started<br />
instead of never having moved in the first place<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8">8</a></sup>.<br />
</p>

<p>
A beloved and smart friend once told me kind words. I think they apply<br />
to more people than I would have imagined:<br />
</p>

<p>
<i>Never ever stop. Continue building, creating, and thinking. There are<br />
virtually no limits to how far you can get.</i><br />
</p>

<p>
Do you ever wonder why many people love the genius story? The story<br />
about the person whose brain was once touched by God or Midas himself<br />
when they were born? How are we supposed to compete with these<br />
individuals?  "Why even bother" is what we tell ourselves to appease<br />
our anxiety.  To rationalize our laziness.<br />
</p>

<p>
I think that is wishful thinking. One does not need to be Einstein to<br />
become rich. Yet, it is easier to imagine that our brain is not in the<br />
top 0.05% and, thus, there is no point in trying. Or so we tell<br />
ourselves.<br />
</p>

<p>
I believe that we should work hard despite our perceived weaknesses,<br />
because they matter less than we think. And even less as time goes<br />
by. The more leverage we have, thanks to programming and media, the<br />
less our marginal differences in intelligence matter to achieve<br />
certain things.  At least, so that we all live comfortably.  Writers<br />
reach millions spending pennies&#x2014;if any&#x2013;by using online<br />
blogs. Musicians play for the masses on Spotify without the<br />
distribution costs of CDs. Programmers can control so many processors<br />
for free that they don't even know what to do with them. It has come<br />
to the point where they program the robot army to create applications<br />
about memes<sup><a id="fnr.9" class="footref" href="#fn.9">9</a></sup>. This is the new Renaissance Age. One kindled by the<br />
spark of transistors instead of the printing press or the steam<br />
engine. So, go out there and learn some useful skills. A good place to<br />
start is math.<br />
</p>

<p>
Software will keep eating the world and will increase its complexity<br />
in the process. There is a lot to build. The world will get noisier as<br />
well. In the Information Age, information overload is the order of the<br />
day. Abundance creates a particular form of scarcity; where there is a<br />
lot, there is a lot to sort out. So, let us build the tools that will<br />
help us tackle this paradox.<br />
</p>

<p>
As for me, I will continue to learn about computer science and math.<br />
However, I still need to refine my interests; to find<br />
knowledge-interest fit<sup><a id="fnr.10" class="footref" href="#fn.10">10</a></sup>.  Finding what one loves is not<br />
easy<sup><a id="fnr.11" class="footref" href="#fn.11">11</a></sup>.  In fact, I have not done it myself.  Computer science,<br />
math, and art is a subset in the set of all human knowledge, but that<br />
is not enough.  One must find a subset you feel passionate about&#x2013;at<br />
the bare minimum.<br />
</p>

<p>
You need to enjoy your work more than your unproductive pleasures.<br />
What I call <i>creator's block</i> in this essay is part block and part<br />
procrastination.  Nobody procrastinates when they are doing something<br />
exciting&#x2014;even work. Thus, if you find yourself procrastinating like<br />
I do, perhaps you need to redefine what work is for you.<br />
</p>

<p>
If you want to beat the creator's block, tackle the root causes .<br />
Procrastination fades when you are working in something that makes you<br />
admire yourself.  While we are our own worst critic, we have all felt<br />
proud of our accomplishments.  I am not talking about artificial<br />
accomplishments such as a getting your college degree, getting into<br />
medical school, or finding a new job.  These are external rewards<br />
crafted by society, not by your inner self.  They are accomplishments<br />
on paper and will only make you happy on paper as well.<br />
</p>

<p>
If it is not artificial problems, what kind of problems are we talking<br />
about?  I am talking about those problems that you solved and made you<br />
go into the mirror and think: you rock.  For example, my mom is bad<br />
with electronic devices. One day, though, she fixed her own phone from<br />
a virus and felt ecstatic about it for three days straight.  What is<br />
amusing and endearing about this situation is that I remember that she<br />
once got a salary increase and did not feel as happy. When she got her<br />
raise it felt like the happiness lasted for less than a third of time<br />
and was not as intense in comparison to when she fixed her phone by<br />
herself.  Work on those kind of problems.  The ones that make you and<br />
your friends think, wow, that is pretty cool.<br />
</p>

<p>
In the end, YCombinator's motto of <i>make something people want</i><br />
applies to you in the first place.  Follow the airlines principle of<br />
helping yourself before you start helping others.  Until you start<br />
working on something that people want, you should be working on<br />
something that you want.  And before that, you should be working on<br />
finding out what is it that you want to work on.  You only need one<br />
home run to win the game.<br />
